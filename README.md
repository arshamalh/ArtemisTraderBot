# Artemis Auto Trader

This is just a prototype from years ago (made in 2018, uploaded on github in 2021).

The main focus was on the trading algorithms not clean code, but I appreciate my code anyway.

The Project can easily be up and running, but there is not warranty and don't judge me depending on this.

Maybe I'll rewrite the backend code using Typescript, write some tests and Use Svelte as frontend framework to increase readablity.

But Actually I suggest you to have a look at the original product that I've been working hard on that, but is commercial and not open sourced.
