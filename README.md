# Artemis Auto Trader
This is just a prototype from years ago (more than 3, uploaded on github recently).

The main focus was on the trading algorithms not clean code, but I appreciate my code anyway.

The Project can easily be up and running, but there is not warranty and don't judge me depending and this.

Maybe I'll rewrite the backend code using Typescript, write some tests and Use Svelte as frontend framework to increase readablity.

But Actually I suggest you to have a look at the original product that I've been working hard on that, but is not open sourced.
